# Python_conditional_statement
Few questions regrading the conditional statements using the python. Few modules are used which include datetime and OS.
Datetime is a single module which works with dates and times.
OS module helps to interaction between the user and the operating system.
In this I have join the desktop to create a file and folder and as well as shutdown the system. basically OS module helps in OS-based tasks.
